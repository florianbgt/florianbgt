# 👋 Hi, I’m Florian

I'm a hands-on CTO and full-stack engineer with a track record of building developer tools, scaling backend systems, and leading small, fast-moving teams.

## 🚀 Building NanoAPI

As Co-Founder & CTO of [NanoAPI](https://nanoapi.io) (Techstars Berlin ‘24), I'm building a developer-first platform that helps teams modernize legacy codebases safely and incrementally—one symbol at a time.

**NanoAPI combines:**
- 🛠️ A local CLI [napi](https://github.com/nanoapi-io/napi) for static code analysis and automation
- ☁️ A cloud platform [stackcore](https://github.com/nanoapi-io/stackcore) with a graph UI and APIs for architectural insights
- 🤖 AI-assisted labeling and MCP server for code understanding, modularization, and querying (in progress)

We help developers extract independent units from monoliths with zero rewrites and minimal risk.

## 🧠 I care about

- Making large codebases understandable, maintainable, and modular
- Building tools that empower developers with clarity and control
- Leading with speed, ownership, and purpose in high-trust teams

Languages I use regularly: **TypeScript**, **Go**, **Python**

# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Florian

CTO & Co-Founder of [NanoAPI](https://nanoapi.io), where we're helping engineering teams modernize legacy codebases one endpoint at a time â€” safely, incrementally, and without rewrites.

---

## ðŸš§ What Iâ€™m building

- [`napi`](https://github.com/nanoapi-io/napi): A CLI that analyzes and splits monolithic APIs into independently deployable units
- [stackcore](https://github.com/nanoapi-io/napi) A self-hostable platform with symbol-aware code visualizations, dependency graphs, and queryable insights
- AI tools that label code by domain (e.g. auth, billing) and accelerate modularization

---

## ðŸ’¡ What I care about

- Building tools that give developers visibility, control, and velocity
- Designing systems that scale with complexity, not just size
- Creating calm, high-trust environments that ship great software
